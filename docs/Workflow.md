## Introduction

The Cloak tool is designed to provide seamless encryption and decryption of source code files within CI/CD pipelines, supporting secure collaboration among developers. By using a combination of AES and RSA encryption, the tool ensures that sensitive data and code are protected while being worked on in collaborative environments. This guide will explain how to set up the Cloak tool for integration with CI/CD pipelines and how to collaborate securely.

## Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

### Setup and Configuration

To integrate the Cloak tool into a CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Install Cloak in CI/CD Environment**:
   - Install the Cloak tool on your CI/CD runners. Ensure that the tool is available on all machines involved in the CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Configure Cloak**:
   - Define the necessary variables such as paths for RSA keys, directories for encrypted files, and any custom configuration values required for your specific CI/CD pipeline through `cloak.ini`.

3. **RSA Key Management**:
   - Generate a pair of RSA keys for each developer or team. Store the private key securely on each developer's machine, while the public key can be distributed within the CI/CD environment to encrypt files.

4. **Set Up Encrypted Key Storage**:
   - If not using a key server, ensure that the encrypted AES keys are stored in a secure, shared location accessible to all team members.
   - If using a key server, configure the Cloak tool to request and store encrypted keys through the key server automatically.

5. **Secure Secrets Management**:
   - Use a secure secrets management solution such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or GitHub Secrets to store sensitive environment variables like private RSA keys and key server credentials.

### Automation in CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Encrypt Files Before Deployment**:
   - Integrate the `cloak encrypt` command into your CI/CD pipeline to encrypt source code files before they are deployed.

2. **Decrypt Files During Deployment**:
   - Use the `cloak decrypt` command during deployment or testing to decrypt the source code for use.

3. **Automated Key Rotation**:
   - Implement a mechanism for automatic rotation of RSA keys, ensuring encryption remains secure over time.

## Collaboration Features

### Shared Encryption Key Management

In a collaborative development environment, developers share encryption keys securely to ensure encrypted files can be accessed and modified by authorized team members.

- The **AES encryption key** is used to encrypt files.
- The **AES key is encrypted using RSA** so that only authorized users with the correct RSA private key can decrypt it.
- Collaborators decrypt the same files by decrypting the AES key with their RSA private key.
- The Cloak tool supports two methods of managing encrypted AES keys:
  - **File-based sharing**: The encrypted AES key is stored in a shared location, allowing team members to access it manually.
  - **Key server-based sharing**: A dedicated key server handles AES key storage and retrieval dynamically.

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Developer A encrypts the files**:
   - Runs `cloak encrypt` to generate an AES key.
   - The AES key is encrypted using RSA and stored in the appropriate location.
   - Encrypted files and the AES key are pushed to a shared repository or storage.

2. **Developer B retrieves the encrypted files and AES key**:
   - If using file-based sharing, downloads the AES key from the shared location.
   - If using a key server, requests the encrypted AES key from the key server.

3. **Developer B decrypts the AES key and files**:
   - Uses their RSA private key to decrypt the AES key.
   - Uses the decrypted AES key to decrypt the files.

4. **Developer B modifies and re-encrypts files**:
   - After making changes, Developer B re-encrypts files using a new AES key.
   - The new AES key is encrypted using RSA and stored in the appropriate location.

### Key Server Integration

A key server allows Cloak to manage encryption keys dynamically. This simplifies collaboration and enhances security.

#### Key Server Configuration

- Cloak reads key server settings from `cloak.ini`, which may include:
  - `[keyserver] url`: The URL of the key server.
  - `[keyserver] auth_token`: Authentication credentials (if required).
  - `[keyserver] request_endpoint`: Endpoint used to request the matching aes key
  - `[keyserver] store_endpoint`: Endpoint used to store the aes key

#### Using the Key Server

- **Storing Keys**: When encrypting files, Cloak automatically stores the AES key on the key server.
- **Requesting Keys**: When decrypting, Cloak retrieves the AES key from the key server if available.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If the key server is unavailable, Cloak falls back to file-based encrypted key storage.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong RSA Keys**:
   - Generate RSA keys with a minimum size of 2048 bits.

2. **Avoid Storing Private Keys in Repositories**:
   - Use a secure storage solution such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

3. **Periodic Key Rotation**:
   - Automate key rotation to maintain security over time.

4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Enforce 2FA on platforms where keys or sensitive data are stored.

5. **Encrypt Sensitive Environment Variables**:
   - Store private keys, API credentials, and key server authentication data securely.

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Secure Source Code Encryption in CI/CD
- Encrypt source code using Cloak before deployment.
- Store encrypted AES keys securely for later decryption.

### Scenario 2: Team Collaboration on Encrypted Code
- Developers share encrypted AES keys and files through a key server or secure storage.
- Authorized users decrypt files using their RSA private key.

### Scenario 3: Securing Deployment Artifacts
- Cloak encrypts deployment artifacts (e.g., Docker images, binaries) before production deployment.

## Conclusion

By integrating Cloak into CI/CD pipelines and leveraging its secure encryption 
and decryption capabilities, organizations can ensure source code and sensitive 
data remain protected. Cloakâ€™s flexible encryption scheme, combined with RSA 
key management and optional key server support, enables teams to collaborate 
securely without exposing encryption keys or sensitive files.
